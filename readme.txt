Problems:
  1. I'm confused on the file reading syntax, so it took me a long time to figure it out
  2. There should be more explanation for the step() function, as the explaination is not very clear.
  3. The Vehicle timestamps are timed from the beginning of each time unit, even though the print() prints the 
  info in the list and queue in the end of the time unit. for example in data_00.txt, Kim begins getting
  processed at t=2, but is not printed when t=4, even though her processing time is 2 time units long.  
  4. I wish more sorting methods were allowed, because I already finished coding it, and had to go back and
  rewrite the code.
